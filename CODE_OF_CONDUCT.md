# [Collaboratory Code of Conduct](https://collab-forum.who.int/forum/tos#heading--code-of-conduct)

Like the network of interconnected practitioners passionate about epidemic and pandemic intelligence, Collaboratory is made up of a wide range of partners and practitioners from all over the world who share a repertoire of resources, experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring as well as new public health challenges. Together, we are working on every aspect of Collaboratory initiative - including connecting people; co-creating, developing, and improving tools for transparent, reusable, and comparable advanced analysis; testing, monitoring, and evaluating approaches and tools while sharing best practices and lessons learned.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but differences in perspectives, communication styles and other aspects can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all members of Collaboratory. This is not an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it is intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the pandemic and epidemic intelligence network in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed or used by Collaboratory.

## Aims
The Collaboratory aims to create a safe space for true collaboration to take place. This Code of Conduct is intended to support this aim by setting explicit expectations for Collaboratory interactions, identifying and providing preventative guardrails for potential tensions between Collaboratory members, and detailing processes for mitigation of problems that may arise.

## Rules of engagement
**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a network that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

**Be transparent.** Collaboratory includes individuals from all over the world, many of whom have never met and may not have interacted previously, and it is important for people to understand whom they are sharing information and ideas with. Filling in your profile is an important part of helping all know who they are in community and conversation with, and when joining Collaboratory, we recommend adding the following information in the custom field (at a minimum): full name and current affiliation/s. You may also consider adding additional information about your background, a profile picture, and/or links to external sites where people can find out more about you and your work (e.g., a LinkedIn or Google Scholar page), what you are interested in collaborating on.

**Be mindful.** Choose your words wisely, as the communications you have online can impact other members and colleagues. Take into consideration the consequences when acting. Use clear and concise language to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations. This makes it easier for others to understand your point and participate in the discussion. Remember that we are a worldwide network, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, in fact different opinions can lead to great innovation! But disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of Collaboratory should be respectful when dealing with other members.

**Be agreeable, even when you disagree.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Collaboratory is no exception. The strength of Collaboratory comes from its people from a wide range of backgrounds and different perspectives on issues. if there is disagreement, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. Be mindful to constructively critic ideas, not people.

**Be patient, be timely.** Bear in mind that many contributors are participating in their free time, and people are often very busy. If you are waiting for something, or an answer to a question, be patient. If someone is waiting for you to do something for them, you should be extended the same courtesy, but at the same time, try to respond as promptly as you can. If you really cannot find the time, let them know, and ask your Community of Practice Lead or Collaboratory Secretariat to help you find someone else to follow-up.

**Be collaborative.** Think carefully about the way you handle communication – make sure it is useful, and that it does not make another contributor’s job harder. Do not complicate communication by trying to discuss multiple topics at once or making off-topic comments. Contribute to other threads if you have a useful point to make or can answer someone else’s question. Create value by sharing valuable information, resources, insightful comments, and constructive feedback.

**Be clear.** When posting in the Collaboratory forum, consider the purpose of your post. For example: are you disseminating information, seeking input on existing work with established collaborators, providing a resource or tool for others to use, or inviting contributions to a project? We recommend being explicit about what you’re looking for out of the interaction.

**Acknowledge the contributions of others.** This is intended as a collaborative space, and we learn from and are stronger working together. All shared content, work done jointly, and relevant contributions should be acknowledged.

- Do not post data that you do not own without explicit permission of the data owner, unless the data are publicly available. The data source and data owner (if different) should be acknowledged when posting data, and links to the data source should be provided whenever possible.

- If someone has shared ideas or data, consult with them before incorporating these into your own work. Sharing in this forum is intended to promote collaboration and does not constitute permission for independent use.

- Collaboratory members exist within institutions and their own personal and professional networks; thus, some projects and collaborations that benefit from Collaboratory interactions may include non-Collaboratory members.

- If you are inviting contributions to a project, we recommend early and open discussion of how these contributions will be credited in any resulting outputs. Cooke et al. (see Recommended Further Reading) provide useful suggestions for navigating issues of authorship in particular, though it is important to note that issues of credit and acknowledgement also require care in context other than academic publications.

**If you see a problem, flag it.** If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct or engaging in other problematic behaviour contrary to the Collaboratory’s aims and values, please report it by emailing collaboratory@who.int. **All reports will be kept confidential.** If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by the Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. Knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the code of conduct or the processes surrounding it.

## Enforcement
Collaboratory Secretariat will investigate reported incidents regarding violations of the code of conduct in a timely manner and decide upon a response. In some cases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made or a specific party or institution will need to be notified. If that is the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals give permission to disclose their identities.

Violations of the code of conduct can lead to the following measures with regards to participation in the Collaboratory platform:

- **Warning.** Appropriate measure when the individual may not have been aware they violated the code of conduct or may have been acting in good faith. An apology or acknowledgment may be requested.

- **Temporary ban.** A measure that prevents a person to use Collaboratory resources or participate in Collaboratory initiative activities for a specific period of time (default: 30 days). Usually enforced when the individual has already received a warning beforehand. An apology or acknowledgment may be requested.

- **Permanent ban.** A measure that prevents a person to use Collaboratory resources or participate in Collaboratory initiative activities indefinitely. Usually enforced when the individual has already received warnings and/or temporary ban measures beforehand, or behaviour poses a serious threat to the health and/or safety of Collaboratory.

Our community is something we build together. We are excited to have you as part of Collaboratory and look forward to what we can all create!
